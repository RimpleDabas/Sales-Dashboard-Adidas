-  In comparison to year 2020 there was an increase in profit of about 200 % (But we have to take into consideration that the dataset for 2020 does not include sales revenue from Amazon )"
- For year 2021 profit and sales both peaked during the summer months
-  Best performers amongst sales made by retailors, Foot locker made the highest number of sales in 2021 and West gear for the yeare 2020.
